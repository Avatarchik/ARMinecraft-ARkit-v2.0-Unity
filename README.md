# Unity-ARKit-Plugin #

[**Latest Update:** This plugin now supports new ARKit functionality exposed in ARKit 2.0.  See [Whats New In ARKit 2.0](./docs/WhatsNewInARKit2_0.md) for details.]

This is a native [Unity](https://unity3d.com/) plugin that exposes the functionality of Appleâ€™s
[ARKit SDK](https://developer.apple.com/arkit/) to your Unity projects for compatible iOS devices.  Includes ARKit features such as world tracking, pass-through camera rendering, horizontal and vertical plane detection and
update, face tracking (requires iPhone X), image anchors, point cloud extraction, light estimation, and hit testing API to Unity developers for their AR projects. This plugin is a _preview quality_ build that
will help you get up and running quickly, but the implementation and APIs are subject to change.  Nevertheless, it is quite capable of creating a full featured ARKit app, and hundreds of ARKit apps on the AppStore already use this plugin.

Please read [LICENSE](./LICENSE) for licensing information.

The code drop is a Unity project, compatible with Unity 2017.4 and later. It contains the plugin sources, example scenes, and components that you may use in your own projects.  See [TUTORIAL.txt](./TUTORIAL.txt) for detailed setup instructions.

Please feel free to extend the plugin and send pull requests. You may also provide feedback if you would like improvements or want to suggest changes.  Happy coding and have fun!
